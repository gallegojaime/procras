- Unix philosophy: take input from stdin, output in simple TSV format.

	13	Do foo\n
	27	Do bar\n
	365	Do qux\n

- Develop a new program that uses cron et al. to warn instead of just list.

- Change machine-friendly format with --human-readable and --more-human-readable.
	[default], --machine-readable:
	13	Do foo\n

	--human-readable:

	13d	Do foo\n

	--more-human-readable:

	13 days	Do foo\n

- Round days to weeks, weeks to years... when apt/fitting. Only in human-readable or
  when time unit explicitly specified as a flag, to avoid confusion.

	13d	Do foo\n

	becomes...

	2w	Do foo\n


	However, this would not be apt because of imprecision:

	200d	Do qux\n

	becoming...

	1y	Do qux\n


	This would not be apt either:

	200d	Do qux\n

	becoming...

	29w	Do qux\n

	because when does one think about 200 days as 30 weeks, apart from pregnancy?
	Days usually make comparisons to other scales easier. To force week-rounding,
	one can use --week-rounding option (maybe with a --pregnancy alias :) ).
